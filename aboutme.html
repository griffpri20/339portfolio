            <h1> about me </h1>

            <p>Hi, welcome to my page. I’m a senior undergraduate student at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, and plan on graduating in May 2020. Academically, I’m pursuing a major in data analytics through the
            <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/">School of Information</a>, and a business minor. </p>

            <p>I’ve lived in Michigan my entire life. I was born and raised in Lathrup Village (which is less than 2 square miles in size), have a younger brother and two dogs. Some of my hobbies include making cookies, fitness, reading, soccer, golf, and winning intermural championships. </p>
