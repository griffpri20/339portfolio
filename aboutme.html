            <h1> about me </h1>

            <p>Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Griff Prime and I’m a senior undergraduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I plan on graduating in May of 2020. Academically, I’m pursuing a major in data/information analytics through the
            <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/">School of Information</a>, and a business minor.</p>

            <p>Professionally, I'm currently seeking a job as an analyst (hopefully in Chicago!) to continue honing and improving upon the skills I've gained from the School of Information. I'm passionate about using my people skills, technology, and data to help clients and companies make better business decisions. I've held many internship positions at companies including Comerica Bank, Health Alliance Plan, Public Financial Management, and Morgan Stanley. Ultimately, I'm excited about the opportunity to start my professional career.</p>

            <p>I’ve lived in Michigan my entire life. I was born and raised in Lathrup Village (which is less than 2 square miles in size), have a younger brother and two dogs (Lucy and Riley). I attended Detroit Country Day school in Beverly Hills, Michigan for my K-12 education. Some of my hobbies include making cookies, fitness, reading, soccer, golf, and winning intermural championships </p>
